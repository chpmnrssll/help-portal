# Register Document

If a document has been requested which has not been automatched from the users document library, responding users can _**select**_ and _**deselect**_ documents to the proposed reply.

When a responding user chooses to register a document, the user clicks the _**Add Document**_ where a new screen is displayed where the user can upload the document. As part of this process, the responding user can _**name**_ the document and _**add predefined metadata**_ and an expiry date for the document if requested.
