# Complete Request

When responding to a document request, users receive a notification of a document request from a counterparty which they must be able to fulfil.

The responding users can access the request in two ways:

* Via a _**notification**_ which contains an action button
* Via their _**task list**_

Any document types registered in the responding user&#39;s library are _**automatched**_ to the given request and are proposed for selection.

Responding users can _**select**_ or _**deselect**_ a checkbox to add/remove a document from the request, for example, if the wrong passport has been automatched.
