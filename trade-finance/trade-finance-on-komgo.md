# Trade Finance on komgo

Trade Finance is one of the core products provided on komgo. It facilitates the application for financing on behalf of the organisations, and after acceptance, simplifies sharing of information and documents related to the instrument with all the relevant stakeholders.

For the Applicant and Beneficiary, komgo displays their lists of trades including sales and purchases on the Trade Dashboard. The Trade Dashboard allows the user to view all their trades received from the trading platform like VAKT, and their status in real time.

An Applicant can seamlessly apply for a Letter of Credit for one of their purchases via the Trade Dashboard. The issuing bank then issues the instrument on the platform.
