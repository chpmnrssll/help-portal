# Relationship Manager  \(Banks\)

The Relationship Manager acts as the facilitator in a trade finance transaction on behalf of the corporate Applicant or Beneficiary, depending on the Banks role in a given commodity trade. If the Bank is acting as the Issuing Bank, the Relationship Manager&#39;s primary role is the review and issuance of a requested Letter of Credit by the Applicant. In the role of the Advising Bank, the Relationship Manager reviews the received export LC and advises it to the Beneficiary. The Relationship Manager is also responsible for the management of counterparties.
