# Trade Finance Manager \(Corporates\)

The Trade Finance Manager is responsible for the financing of a transaction, either the export or the import legs. If the corporate is the buyer in a given trade transaction, the Trade Finance Manager&#39;s role is that of the Applicant requesting financing for a trade from a bank. The corporate can also be the selling party in a trade transaction. In this case the Trade Finance Manager is responsible for reviewing the letter of credit issued in its organization&#39;s favour by the Issuing Bank, as well as managing the collection and presentation of trade documents for the given trade.
