# LC Dashboard

On the LC Dashboard, users \(Applicant, Beneficiary, Issuing Bank and Advising Bank\)can see the list of Letters of Credit in which their organisation have been involved on the komgo platform.

Key information about the Letter of Credit is displayed on the dashboard including a live status, role and action indicator, as well as LC specific data including the expiry, latest shipment date and amount. Details of a particular LC and the performance of pending actions, which depend on the user&#39;s role, can be accessed through this dashboard.
