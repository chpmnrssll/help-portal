# Upgrades

komgo will communicate new releases over email to the authorized email address provided during business on-boarding. Reference upgrade scripts will be provided with release notes.


There will be monthly releases during first 6 months, followed by Quarterly releases.


Emergency patches will be released as required.


These releases must first be applied in the QA region, and later promoted to Production during the pre-defined deployment window for each release. It is recommended that all members upgrade and stay current with the releases.
