# Hosting Environment - HW Requirements

Member companies should have finalized a hosting environment that supports running docker images.

This could be an on-premise server, or a cloud server such as Azure or AWS that supports running docker images.

The following minimum hardware/software is required per each environment \(Production, QA\):



*   One server equivalent to AWS C4-X2Large or larger
    *   8 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 1 GBPS Network Bandwidth
