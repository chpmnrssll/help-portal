# How to configure Keycloak for HTTP \(for QA region\)

**Problem:**

If you want to enable keycloak to respond to non https requests normally (DEVELOPMENT ONLY - of course)

**Solution:**

Step-by-step guide



1.  Edit the configure.sh script and add the following lines

```
echo "[ Set sslRequired for komgo (and master) realms according to variable ]"
docker exec komgo-keycloak /opt/jboss/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh update realms/komgo -s sslRequired=$KEYCLOAK_SSL_REQUIRED
docker exec komgo-keycloak /opt/jboss/keycloak/bin/kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=$KEYCLOAK_SSL_REQUIRED
```



Attention, these command, one for each realm, only work after the kcadm.sh has been connected with login password which is performed in 

/opt/jboss/keycloak/bin/scripts/keycloak-init.sh



1.  In this script or where you set all your variables, set the KEYCLOAK_SSL_REQUIRED to 
    * "none" if you need disabling mandatory https request (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
    * "external" (default) if only requests from outside the docker or docker network should be https
    * "all" if all requests should be https 
1.  Restart keycloak docker instance (or all dockers), et voila
