Attributes in "Black" are information assigned to the Member Company by komgo. They must be used to configure the env file

Attributes in "<font color="green">Green</font>" are sample entries, Member Companies are strongly encouraged to not use the provided password, and generate their own.

All passwords are one-time use passwords, Member Companies must change them upon first login. <TODO: Is this true? Can they change their COMMON Broker password? Especially when their account is only setup after they sign up?>
