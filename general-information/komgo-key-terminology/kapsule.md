# kapsule

Kapsule is the suite of Components that a Member Company runs to participate in the komgo Network.

#### Introduction of kapsule

The **komgo** **kapsule** is an all contained environment. In a kapsule are components, such as database, identity and authentication module and of course the **komgo** application. Setting yourself up in a **kapsule** your fastest- and most hassle free way to market.

#### All contained and tuned

With all components running in one **kapsule** they can be tuned and versions can be controlled in isolation of the components running in other **kapsules**.  Also monitoring, maintenance can be standardized making support a dream.

#### Logical separation \(TIER-1\)

Since a **kapsule** is self-contained with no way to connect to other **kapsules** it is a great way to host multiple corporates on one environment. A most economical setup!
