# Role management

#### _View roles_

Click the _**Administration &gt; Role Management**_ menu buttons on the left side of the screen to be transitioned to a list view of all of the available roles.

#### _Add role_

Administrators can add a new role with a customized set of permissions on the komgo platform.

On the Role Management screen, click _**Add New**_ and enter the _**role title**_ and a _**role description**_. Select the _**actions**_ and _**associated permissions**_ one or more functionalities from the list to define the roles authorizations on the komgo platform in the _**permissions**_ tab.

You can now assign the selected role to a user\(s\) by navigating to the _**Users**_ tab and clicking a user&#39;s name \(e.g. Bob\)  on the right hand side to assign and left hand side to unassign the selected user the role. Once you have added the user\(s\) to the role click _**Create Role**_ or click _**Cancel**_ to delete the above actions performed.

#### _Manage roles_

Administrators can edit and delete an existing role custom role. Predefined system roles cannot be deleted, but assign or unassigned to users through the _**Edit**_ feature.

To delete an existing role, click the _**ellipsis**_ beside the custom role and click _**Delete**_ the role. Click _**Delete**_ or _**Cancel**_ in the confirmation box.

To modify an existing role, click the _**ellipsis**_ \(e.g. Trade Finance Manager\) and click the _**Edit**_ to modify the role. On the edit screen, the user can view the role title and edit the role description, the actions and associated permissions and assigned users. If the user has modified the role they can click _**Update Role**_ or click _**Cancel**_ to return the role to its unedited state.

For predefined system roles provided by the komgo platform the role editing feature is limited to modifying the assignment of users to the given role.
