# User Administration on komgo

On the komgo platform, roles and users are managed by the Administrator at the company level. The komgo platform verifies that every action a user performs on the platform has been authorized in the context of the role and permitted actions assigned to them by the Administrator.

By enabling companies to define roles and managing their assignment to users, komgo provides the flexibility required to reflect the differences between users and their respective responsibilities within and across organizations. A set of predefined system roles is available to streamline the process of user and role management.
