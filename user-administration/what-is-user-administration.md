# What is User Administration?

User Administration refers to the management of roles and users on the komgo platform.

Roles on the platform reflect different personas and their respective responsibilities in an organization, for example, a KYC Analyst, or Trade Finance Manager. Each role is able to access different functionalities and perform different actions on the platform based on the responsibilities of their role and the rights assigned to them by their respective organizations.

Roles are defined through the selection of a predefined set of permitted actions. These roles can then be assigned to appropriate users within an organisation to enable them to perform actions on the platform required by their responsibilities.
